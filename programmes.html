            <h2><I>CMDJ</I></h2>
        </li>
        <P>CMJD was fully designed for UNDERGRADUATE students who are studying in Government and Private Universities to
            enhance the knowledge and skills of software developments to the industry standards and also giving
            marvellous
            software development training enabling modern software design and developing methodologies (architectural
            designs and using depth of object orientation) to fill the gap between students and current IT job
            requirements.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>Even though plenty of theory subjects have been studied in the universities, students are not able to match
            their primary qualification to get into the IT industry, therefore IJSE introduced this program for the
            students to fulfill their expectation. According to the past statistics of IJSE, more than 4500
            undergraduate students have been produced to IT Industry Island wide.</p>
